## Description and Motivation

A database for massage therapists and massage therapists in training to share
treatment strategies for common musculoskeletal conditions.  The main objective
is to create a resource for massage therapists so that they can provide the best
treatments possible for their clients.  Also the goal is to create a centralized
knowledge base to help massage therapists in training learn techniques and develop
a firmer understanding of the basic kinesiology and anatomy that massage techniques
are based on.

As a user, I should be able to look up a musculoskeletal disorder and receive a list of massage techniques for addressing that condition and a description of the disorder.

As a user, I should be able to login to the site.

As a user with correct access, I should be able to add/edit/delete massage techniques.

## Stretch Goals User Stories

As a user, I should be able to add comments to a massage technique to give feedback on
effectiveness or alternate ways of doing it.
